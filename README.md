Project Title: Electricity Meter Polling and Management System

Project Description:

The Electricity Meter Polling and Management System is a web-based application designed to remotely poll and manage multiple electricity meters. The system allows users to configure settings, add and remove devices, and monitor the status of electricity meters in real-time.

Key Features:

Device Management: Users can add and remove devices (electricity meters) with their respective serial numbers and communication ports (COM ports) in the system.

Command Management: The system supports the configuration of specific commands required for polling each electricity meter. Users can add or remove commands from a list of available commands, which are read from a CSV file.

Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface allows users to configure settings, manage devices and commands, and view the results of the polling process.

Real-time Polling: The application continuously polls the connected electricity meters using the selected commands and displays the results in a well-organized table format on the web interface.

Automatic Error Handling: The system handles errors and exceptions, such as incorrect configurations or communication issues, and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

Portability: The application is designed to be platform-independent and can be run on any system with Python and the required libraries installed.

Extensibility: The code is modular and easy to modify, making it simple to add new features or adapt the system for different use cases.

In summary, the Electricity Meter Polling and Management System provides a convenient and efficient way to manage and monitor multiple electricity meters remotely. With its user-friendly web interface and powerful features, it can help users effectively oversee their electricity meter networks and gain insights into their usage patterns.
